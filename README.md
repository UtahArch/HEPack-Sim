# ML-HE Simulator


## Using the Simulator

## About the Codebase

### Simulation

- defs.py: Defines architectural and secutrity parameters used for the simulation.
- elements.py: All definitions for the hardware structures (Multiplier, Caches, etc) and their stat collection.
- funcs.py: All definitions for the different Functional Units (ModMult, NTT, Automorph, etc) used by the workloads.
- packings.py: All definitions for the different packings and pipelines implemented.

Different packings implemented:

- run_channel.py: Channel Packing as defined in [GAZELLE: A Low Latency Framework for Secure Neural Network Inference](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity18/presentation/juvekar)
- run_cheetah.py: Cheetah Packing as defined in [Low Latency Privacy Preserving Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10659)
- run_epic.py   : Packing as described in [EPIC: Efficient Packing for Inference using Cheetah](https://sarabjeetsingh007.github.io/files/cogarch22.pdf)
- run_gala.py   : Packing as described in [GALA: Greedy ComputAtion for Linear Algebra in Privacy-Preserved Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01827)
- run_hyena.py  : Packing discussed in [Hyena: Balancing Packing, Reuse, and Rotations for Encrypted Inference (yet to appear in SP'24)]()
- run_lion.py   : Packing as described in [Cheetah: Lean and Fast Secure Two-Party Deep Neural Network Inference](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/huang-zhicong)
- run_ngraph.py : Packing as described in [nGraph-HE: a graph compiler for deep learning on homomorphically encrypted data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3310273.3323047)
- run_<packing>plus.py : Packing with smart batching

### Scripts

- calc_output.py: Calculates the total number of output neurons present for every layer. Used for computing the communication cost.
- charts.ipyb: Used for plotting all the charts (and more) present in [Hyena](). Also contains energy numbers extracted from cacti.
- make_folders.sh: Used to create folders for storing the data being generated by the different simulations.
- run_all.sh: Used to run multiple different experiments.

### Workloads

Parameters for the neural networks have been obtained from [Maestro](All definitions for the different structures in the Engine and the basic) (for ...) while resnet20 ... .
